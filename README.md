# 🏥 MediTrack – Jetpack Compose Patient & Appointment Manager

MediTrack is a simple **Jetpack Compose** Android application that manages **patients** and their **appointments**, built using only the fundamentals taught in **Lab 06**:

- `@Composable`
- `@Preview`
- `remember`, `mutableStateOf`, `mutableStateListOf`
- `Column`, `Row`, `Box`, `LazyColumn`
- `Text`, `Button`, `TextField`
- `Modifier`

No ViewModel, no Navigation component — screen switching is done using simple lambdas and app-level state.
